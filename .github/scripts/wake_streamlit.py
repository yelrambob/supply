"""Load the Streamlit app in a real browser and click through the sleep screen if present.

A plain HTTP ping doesn't keep a Streamlit Community Cloud app awake because the
"gone to sleep" screen only wakes up in response to a real page load (with the
"Yes, get this app back up!" button clicked), not a bare curl request.

A cold rebuild (reinstalling requirements.txt and starting the container) can take
several minutes, not seconds -- give it a generous window rather than failing fast.
